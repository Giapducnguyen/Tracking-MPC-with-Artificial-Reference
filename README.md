# Tracking-MPC-with-Artificial-Reference
This repository contains the file reproducing the simulation results of the paper: Lim√≥n, Daniel, et al. "MPC for tracking piecewise constant references for constrained linear systems." Automatica 44.9 (2008): 2382-2387.

Perhaps the most confusing part is how to compute the set $\mathcal{O}_{\infty, \lambda}^{w}$. For that reason, it is recommended to read the following paper:

Gilbert, Elmer G., and K. Tin Tan. "Linear systems with state and control constraints: The theory and application of maximal output admissible sets." IEEE Transactions on Automatic control 36.9 (1991): 1008-1020.
